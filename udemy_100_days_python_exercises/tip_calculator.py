#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Example Input 
#Welcome to the tip calculator!
#What was the total bill? $124.56
#How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
#How many people to split the bill? 7

#Example Output
#Each person should pay: $19.93

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
